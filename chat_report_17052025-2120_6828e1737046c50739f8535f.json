        "User: Iâ€™ve been feeling really anxious for a few months, especially at school",
        "Assistant: Sofia, I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling anxious. That can be really tough to deal with, especially at school where you're supposed to feel safe and supported.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's been going on for you? Is there something specific that's triggered these feelings of anxiety, or has it just kind of built up over time?",
        "User: I feel like everyone is judging me. Even when nothing happens, I just freeze and want to disappear. Maybe it's all in my head and it's not real",
        "Assistant: Thank you for sharing your situation with me. A report has been created and will be reviewed by a professional. Please take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything further in the future."
