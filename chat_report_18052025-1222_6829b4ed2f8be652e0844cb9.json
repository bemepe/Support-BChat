        "Assistant: Hello there, friend! I'm here for you, and everything we talk about is completely safe and confidential. You can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with me. I want you to know that you're not alone, and I'm here to listen and help in any way I can. Take a deep breath and let's start talking - I'm all ears!",
        "User: Hi, I’m afraid to go back to school tomorrow",
        "Assistant: How old are you?",
        "User: I am twelve years old",
        "Assistant: What's your name?",
        "User: my name is Daniel Fernandez",
        "Assistant: What city do you live in?",
        "User: I live in Zaragoza, near the city centre",
        "Assistant: What's been going on that makes you feel like you need someone to talk to?",
        "User: I am afraid to go to school. There are three boys at school who keep threatening me. Yesterday one of them pushed me into the lockers and said next time I’d be hurt worse",
        "Assistant: Daniel, I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling scared and uncomfortable at school. That must be really tough for you.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's been going on with these boys? What do you think they want from you, or why do you think they're behaving this way towards you?",
        "User:  I don't feel safe. They wait for me after class and follow me. I told a teacher once but they just said to ignore them. I think it is very important that someone helps me quickly.",
        "Assistant: Thank you for trusting me with your feelings and situation. I've classified this as an urgent case, and a mental health professional will be notified immediately. They'll be in touch with you as soon as possible to provide support. Take care of yourself during this time."
