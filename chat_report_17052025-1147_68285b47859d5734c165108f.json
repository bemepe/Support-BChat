        "Assistant: Fatima, I can imagine how uncomfortable and scared you must feel when your brother's friends come over. Can you tell me more about what happens when they're at your house? Is it something specific that makes you feel anxious or is it just a general feeling of unease?",
        "User: i often don't even remember what they do to me, but they usually come on monday nights, they always hit me or hurt me in other ways, i don't think my brother knows about it. i need help but i'm afraid they won't believe me.",
